***All levels can be accessed through the finalproj uproject**
***both built using ue4 1.17.2***

the levels titled "water_flow" and "other_distortion" were my attempts to create a post process material that distorts the camera view using any custom texture. I ended up being unable to reproduce the sceneTexture:postprocessinput0 node and had to settle for a more basic custom node. things such as panning the texture or scaling based on position are used to create non-static effects
